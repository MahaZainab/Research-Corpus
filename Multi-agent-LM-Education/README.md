# Weekly Planner â€” Multi-Agent LLMs for Education

This week(15-09-2025) Iâ€™ll read **Research articles in the domain of education who have used language models (SLMs, LLMs) along with single and multi-agent systems** from  [`Research-Corpus/Multi-agent-LM-Education`](https://github.com/MahaZainab/Research-Corpus/tree/main/Multi-agent-LM-Education).

In the meeting, we have seen how we can make multiple small language models as teacher judges and how can we improve time and memory constraints.
Also, see the adaboost algorithm. This is going

### Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multilingual Code Instruction Tuning
**Goal:** The goal of this paper reading is to analyze how the mutilingual instruction tunning has been done performed across multiple agents. Also, what are the limitation of their methodology.

**Questions:** The following questions has been proposed to achieve our goal.
1. What are the research questions of this study.
2. What are the methodolgy of instruction tunning.
3. How SLMs are interacting with each other.

**Measures:** The following measures are defined to answer the above questions.
1. How the achieve 

**My Learnings:**
Most code LLMs fine tunned on high-quality instruction dataset and in this way they are capable of wide range of code related tasks. In this paper, the purpose is to knowledge transfer among different languages.
They have created a framework which will do a collaboration between multiple agents so that they can generate data to fine tune LLM.
They have break down it in multiple steps. First, they generate the language specific data from the code snippet.
