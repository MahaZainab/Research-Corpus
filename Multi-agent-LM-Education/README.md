# Weekly Planner â€” Multi-Agent LLMs for Education

This week(15-09-2025) Iâ€™ll read **Research articles in the domain of education who have used language models (SLMs, LLMs) along with single and multi-agent systems** from  [`Research-Corpus/Multi-agent-LM-Education`](https://github.com/MahaZainab/Research-Corpus/tree/main/Multi-agent-LM-Education).

In the meeting, have see how we can make small LLM
