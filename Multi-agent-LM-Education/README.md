# Weekly Planner — Multi-Agent LLMs for Education

A simple **1-paper-per-day** plan using items from  
[`Research-Corpus/Multi-agent-LM-Education`](https://github.com/MahaZainab/Research-Corpus/tree/main/Multi-agent-LM-Education).

> ⚠️ Note: This README includes an **auto-fill step** to insert the actual paper filenames from the GitHub folder (see the “Auto-fill papers from GitHub” section). Run it once and your table below will be replaced with the real list.
