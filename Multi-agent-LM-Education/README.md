# Weekly Planner — Multi-Agent LLMs for Education

This week I’ll read **research articles in the domain of education who have used language models(SLMs, LLMs) along with single and multi-agent systems** from  
[`Research-Corpus/Multi-agent-LM-Education`](https://github.com/MahaZainab/Research-Corpus/tree/main/Multi-agent-LM-Education).
