## Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- **Pass@k (esp. Pass@1)** on benchmarks: HumanEval, MBPP, MultiPL-E.  
- **Ablation studies**: role of Ds₁–Ds₄.  
- **Scaling experiments**: performance by dataset size.

### Qualitative Measures
- **Reflection analysis**: quality, clarity, correctness, novelty of generated samples.  
- **Cross-lingual transfer effectiveness**: improvements in low-resource programming languages.

### Limitations
- Scope restricted to **multilingual code tasks** only.  
- Possible **language imbalance** (better for high-resource languages).  
- Risks of **LLM scorer bias** during filtering and reflection.
